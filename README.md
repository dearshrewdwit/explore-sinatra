## Spelunking: A simple sinatra app

### Learning Objectives
1. Explain how to spelunk code
2. Spelunk code to get visibility on how an app works

### Instructions

##### NB: Start from [config.ru](config.ru)

For **every** file in this directory:
1. Read each line and add a comment explaining what it does. You might want multiple comments for parts of each line. Feel free to sketch diagrams.
2. If you're not sure what something does, spend **no more than 10 mins** researching it. As you do, note down the set of resources that you use. If there's more research to be done - mark it down and move on to the next part of the line, or the next line.
3. Identify areas of ignorance that you have marked out. Write out questions to help you frame your research.
